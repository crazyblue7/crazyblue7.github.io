        <h1>&nbsp;Hello guys!</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">I don't know how to change the font in HTML or CSS and I don't even know if you change the font in the HTML or if it's in CSS, probably in CSS. <br> <br> Also, when I touch type I usually have a couple errors. <br> And also I like Visual Studio Code. (and this is just one line (line 11) in the html file, you can check the github repo to verify if you want) Don't forget that I really like <em>Comic Sans</em></p>
